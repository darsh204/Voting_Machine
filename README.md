# Voting_Machine
This Verilog-based project implements a digital voting machine that registers and validates votes for four candidates. It includes modules for debouncing button inputs, logging votes, and displaying results via LEDs. The system operates in two modes: voting and result display, ensuring accurate vote counting and clear result visualization
